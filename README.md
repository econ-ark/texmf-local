# texmf-local: Econ-ARK default local LaTeX metafiles

This is a directory structure that can be copied over to 
a user's `/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local` directory on MacOS
or linux.  If the proper paths are set in the texmf.cfg file,
an installation of TeXLive should be able to find such files 
with a command like `kpsewhich system.bib`
